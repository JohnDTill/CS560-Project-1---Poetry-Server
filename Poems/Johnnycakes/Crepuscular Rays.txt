Crepuscular Rays (or Sunbeam in Richmond)

Sitting back against the bed on the floor
I see no point in hurting anymore
A bright world is waiting out the door

where doughnut dough is proofing in the kitchen
birds are singing for anyone who listens
the trees reach upward, where the sun glistens

No one ever did me wrong.
