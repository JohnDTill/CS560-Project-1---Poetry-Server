The pick was anxious and distraught
to learn that it was not a key-
The lock held with tumblers caught;
Immune to his appeals was she.

The lock was flattered yet unmoving-
This silly pick was unaware,
Of course she would reserve her swooning,
A lock and pick are not a pair.

The foolish pick remained persistent,
Resolved that he would try again.
He could not let his lock be distant.
Ah-ha! He chanced upon a pin.

Could he set the pins in sequence?
Would she bid her latch depart?
Dear lock, prepare your strongest defense,
for I am picking at your heart.


Addendum:
The latch never surrendered,
but that end was okay:
the pick was tempered
and the lock had a key.
