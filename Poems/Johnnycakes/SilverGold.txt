What endeared me to this landscape?
In part the warm, inviting lakes-
Admiring the waters, they return my gaze.
Those smooth and soft sweeping hills,
where my mind wanders still.
That warm and giving sun
beaming outward to everyone.
The cool springs supporting plants
and offering rest to fearsome cats.
Wide open views which ennoble,
giving glimpses of the total.
With all the grandeur I've been shown,
I would call her e home.
