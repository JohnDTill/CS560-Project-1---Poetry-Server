Table on a deck
overlooking Chelan,
with a hundred-mile trek
to the next town.

Sitting with Blade,
Breezy and Du Jour-
I spoke up to pay
a round of beers and ciders

hoping to keep
the mood lighter
while letting slip
"I might be a section hiker."

They took it gracefully,
but pushed me to stay.
I thought about leaving,
but pressed on the next morning.
