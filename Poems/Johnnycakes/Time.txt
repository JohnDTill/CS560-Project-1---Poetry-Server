Sun beams scatter on the wet window,
with crepe myrtle in vibrant bloom.
I think about where I will go
to find peace and room.

Something real lives here,
but I bought into a lie.
This place glimmers,
but not in my eye.

------------------------------------

Summer leaves glow orange then fade,
revealing blazing stars above.
I think about if I stayed
to lean into healing love.

Something real lives here,
there's a reason I've come.
This place glimmers,
with light not overcome.

------------------------------------

Seasons cycle round again,
summer rain soaks the earth.
My tired will wears thin,
longing for rebirth.

Something real lives here,
but I gave my all.
This place glimmers-
still will when I'm gone.
